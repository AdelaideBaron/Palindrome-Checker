# Palindrome Checker 🔡

- **Author**: Adelaide Baron 
- **Use**: User input, check if the word is a palindrome 
- **Purpose**: Requirement of wk1 Java with Sparta Global 
- **Date**: 26/05/2022

## How it works: 
1. Set input within the main method.   
2. Palindrome checker method (PCM) ensures input word is lower case
3. PCM splits word into array of letters 
4. Using a loop, we iterate through the array to create another with reversed order
5. We concatenate the 'backwards' array to create a word that is the original input, backwards
6. Compare the two words to see if they are the same or not 
7. If they are equal, we output true. If not, output false. 


### WIP 🛠️

- Refactor, this is not an easy to read code. I need to seperate the method into seperate methods, and adjust the structure.
- User input word - had to remove due to testing difficulty. Will reintroduce once I can successfully test it. 
- Text output  - similarly, struggling to test this.
